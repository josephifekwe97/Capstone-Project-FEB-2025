# Kubernetes Application Deployment

This repository contains Kubernetes configurations for deploying applications in both development and production environments using Kustomize. The configuration is designed to be easily integrated with CI/CD pipelines while maintaining clear separation between environments.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Multi-environment Support**: Separate configurations for development and production
- ðŸ“Š **Auto-scaling**: Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for dynamic resource management
- ðŸ”’ **Security**: Environment-specific secrets and configmaps
- ðŸ“¦ **Containerized**: Docker-based deployment
- ðŸ”„ **CI/CD Ready**: Structured for easy integration with deployment pipelines

## Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   # Install Metrics Server
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
   ```

2. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   # Development
   kubectl apply -k _overlays/dev/

   # Production
   kubectl apply -k _overlays/prod/
   ```
